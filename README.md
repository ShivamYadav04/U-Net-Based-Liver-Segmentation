# U-Net-Based-Liver-Segmentation
This project implements a U-Net based deep learning model for automated liver segmentation from CT scan images. The model is designed to support medical image analysis by segmenting liver regions accurately, which can help in disease diagnosis, treatment planning, and further risk prediction tasks.
